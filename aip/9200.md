TRTA REST API Guidelines
========================

Abstract
--------

Across TRTA, products and platforms are being modernized and brought to
market in new, more accessible ways. It's critical that we drive
consistency around the development interfaces we provide to enhance the
experience of our customers. The TRTA REST Working Group was established
to facilitate this and has decided to unify development processes by the
acceptance of a cross-TRTA API standards document.

This document adopts the guidelines TRTA REST APIs SHOULD follow so
RESTful interfaces are developed consistently and provides guidance on
consumption and extension of those standards.

Guideline Adoption
------------------

In adopting a style guide, the following were considerations:

1.  Already in existence

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  Thorough but not restricting

2.  Publicly available

3.  We can to contribute

4.  Updates are reviewed and require approval

5.  Authored by experts with years of experience creating REST APIs

Expectations for Developers
---------------------------

### Public APIs

Public and/or commercially offered APIs will be hosted via an API
gateway and MUST follow the guidelines recommended and referenced in
this document.

### Internal and Existing APIs

New Internal APIs SHOULD follow the guidelines referenced in this
document. If there are specific concerns around implementation,
engagement with relevant architects MUST help guide the decisions made.

Existing internal APIs MAY be left as-is, though newer versions of
existing endpoints should be compliant with guidelines. Section 4.2 of
the guide provides recommendation regarding existing services.

Official Guideline Version
--------------------------

The guideline adopted is the Microsoft REST API Style Guidelines
referenced below:
