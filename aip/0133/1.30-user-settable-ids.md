### User-specified IDs

Sometimes, an API needs to allow a client to specify the ID component of a
resource (the last segment of the resource name) on creation. This is common if
users are allowed to choose that portion of their resource names.

For example:

```
// Using user-settable IDs.
publishers/lacroix/books/les-miserables

// Using system-generated IDs.
publishers/012345678-abcd-cdef/books/12341234-5678-abcd
```

Create RPCs **may** support this behavior by providing a `string {resource}_id`
field on the request message:

```proto
message CreateBookRequest {
  // The parent resource where this book will be created.
  // Format: publishers/{publisher}
  string parent = 1 [
    (google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED,
    (google.api.resource_reference) = {
      child_type: "library-example.googleapis.com/Book"
    }];

  // The book to create.
  Book book = 2 [(google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED];

  // The ID to use for the book, which will become the final component of
  // the book's resource name.
  //
  // This value should be 4-63 characters, and valid characters
  // are /[a-z][0-9]-/.
  string book_id = 3;
}
```

- The `{resource}_id` field **must** exist on the request message, not the
  resource itself.
  - The field **may** be required or optional. If it is required, it **should**
    include the corresponding annotation.
- The `name` field on the resource **must** be ignored.
- There **should** be exactly one `google.api.method_signature` annotation on
  the RPC, with a value of `"parent,{resource},{resource}_id"`.
- The documentation **should** explain what the acceptable format is, and the
  format **should** follow the guidance for resource name formatting in
  [AIP-122][].
- If a user tries to create a resource with an ID that would result in a
  duplicate resource name, the service **must** error with `ALREADY_EXISTS`.
  - However, if the user making the call does not have permission to see the
    duplicate resource, the service **must** error with `FORBIDDEN` instead.
