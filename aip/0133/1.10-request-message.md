### Request message

Create methods implement a common request message pattern:

```proto
message CreateBookRequest {
  // The parent resource where this book will be created.
  // Format: publishers/{publisher}
  string parent = 1 [
    (google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED,
    (google.api.resource_reference) = {
      child_type: "library-example.googleapis.com/Book"
    }];

  // The book to create.
  Book book = 2 [(google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED];
}
```

- A `parent` field **must** be included unless the resource being created is a
  top-level resource. It **should** be called `parent`.
  - The field **should** be annotated as required.
  - The field **should** identify the [resource type][aip-123] of the resource
    being created.
- The resource field **must** be included and **must** map to the POST body.
- The request message **must not** contain any other required fields and
  **should not** contain other optional fields except those described in this
  or another AIP.
