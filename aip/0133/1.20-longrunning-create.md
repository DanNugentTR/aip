      message: Added guidance for long-running create.

### Long-running create

Some resources take longer to create a resource than is reasonable for a
regular API request. In this situation, the API **should** use a long-running
operation instead:

```proto
rpc CreateBook(CreateBookRequest) returns (google.longrunning.Operation) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{parent=publishers/*}/books"
  };
  option (google.longrunning.operation_info) = {
    response_type: "Book"
    metadata_type: "OperationMetadata"
  }
}
```

- The response type **must** be set to the resource (what the return type would
  be if the RPC was not long-running).
- Both the `response_type` and `metadata_type` fields **must** be specified.
