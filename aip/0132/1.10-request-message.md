### Request message

List methods implement a common request message pattern:

```proto
message ListBooksRequest {
  // The parent, which owns this collection of books.
  // Format: publishers/{publisher}
  string parent = 1 [
    (google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED,
    (google.api.resource_reference) = {
      child_type: "library-example.googleapis.com/Book"
    }];

  // The maximum number of books to return. The service may return fewer than
  // this value.
  // If unspecified, at most 50 books will be returned.
  // The maximum value is 1000; values above 1000 will be coerced to 1000.
  int32 page_size = 2;

  // A page token, received from a previous `ListBooks` call.
  // Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page.
  //
  // When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListBooks` must match
  // the call that provided the page token.
  string page_token = 3;
}
```

- A `parent` field **must** be included unless the resource being listed is a
  top-level resource. It **should** be called `parent`.
  - The field **should** be annotated as required.
  - The field **should** identify the [resource type][aip-123] of the resource
    being listed.
- The `page_size` and `page_token` fields, which support pagination, **must**
  be specified on all list request messages. For more information, see
  [AIP-158][].
  - The comment above the `page_size` field **should** document the maximum
    allowed value, as well as the default value if the field is omitted (or set
    to `0`). If preferred, the API **may** state that the server will use a
    sensible default. This default **may** change over time.
  - If a user provides a value greater than the maximum allowed value, the API
    **should** coerce the value to the maximum allowed.
  - If a user provides a negative or other invalid value, the API **must** send
    an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
- The `page_token` field **must** be included on all list request messages.
- The request message **may** include fields for common design patterns
  relevant to list methods, such as `string filter` and `string order_by`.
- The request message **must not** contain any other required fields, and
  **should not** contain other optional fields except those described in this
  or another AIP.
