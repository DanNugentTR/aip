      message: Added guidance about documenting the ordering behavior.
---

### Ordering

`List` methods **may** allow clients to specify sorting order; if they do, the
request message **should** contain a `string order_by` field.

- Values **should** be a comma separated list of fields. For example:
  `"foo,bar"`.
- The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a
  field, users append a `" desc"` suffix; for example: `"foo desc, bar"`.
- Redundant space characters in the syntax are insignificant.
  `"foo, bar desc"`, `" foo , bar desc "`, and `"foo,bar desc"` are all
  equivalent.
- Subfields are specified with a `.` character, such as `foo.bar` or
  `address.street`.

<!-- TODO(#220): Add a reference to AIP-161 once it is written. -->

**Note:** Only include ordering if there is an established need to do so. It is
always possible to add ordering later, but removing it is a breaking change.
