### Filtering

List methods **may** allow clients to specify filters; if they do, the request
message **should** contain a `string filter` field.

<!-- TODO(#85): Add a reference to a filtering AIP once
                that AIP is written.
  -->

**Note:** Only include filtering if there is an established need to do so. It
is always possible to add filtering later, but removing it is a breaking
change.
