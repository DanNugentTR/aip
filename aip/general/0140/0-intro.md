# Field names

Naming fields in a way that is intuitive to users can often be one of the most
challenging aspects of designing an API. This is true for many reasons; often a
field name that seems entirely intuitive to the author can baffle a reader.

Additionally, users rarely use only one API; they use many APIs together. As a
result, a single company using the same name to mean different things (or
different names to mean the same thing) can often cause unnecessary confusion,
because users can no longer take what they've already learned from one API and
apply that to another.

In short, APIs are easiest to understand when field names are simple,
intuitive, and consistent with one another.
