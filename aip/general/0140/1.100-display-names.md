### Display names

Many resources have a human-readable name, often used for display in UI. This
field **must** generally be called `display_name`, and **must not** have a
uniqueness requirement.

If an entity has an official, formal name (such as a company name or the title
of a book), an API **may** use `title` as the field name instead. The `title`
field **should not** have a uniqueness requirement.
