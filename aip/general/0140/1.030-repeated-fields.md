### Repeated fields

Repeated fields **must** use the proper plural form, such as `books` or
`authors`. On the other hand, non-repeated fields **should** use the singular
form such as `book` or `author`. This implies that resource names **should**
use the singular form as well, since the field name should follow the resource
name (e.g., use `repeated Book books`, **not** `Books books = 1`).
