## Guidance

Field names **should** be in correct American English.

Field names **should** clearly and precisely communicate the concept being
presented and avoid overly general names that are ambiguous. That said, field
names **should** avoid including unnecessary words. In particular, avoid
including adjectives that always apply and add little cognitive value. For
example, a `proxy_settings` field might be as helpful as
`shared_proxy_settings` if there is no unshared variant.
