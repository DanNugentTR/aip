### Case

Field definitions in protobuf files **must** use `lower_snake_case` names.
These names are mapped to an appropriate naming convention in JSON and in
generated code.

Additionally, each word in the field **must not** begin with a number, because
it creates ambiguity when converting between snake case and camel case.
