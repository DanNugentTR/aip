### Prepositions

Field names **should not** include prepositions (such as "with", "for", "at",
"by", etc). For example:

- `error_reason` (**not** `reason_for_error`)
- `author` (**not** `written_by`)

It is easier for field names to match more often when following this
convention. Additionally, prepositions in field names may also indicate a
design concern, such as an overly-restrictive field or a sub-optimal data type.
This is particularly true regarding "with": a field named `book_with_publisher`
likely indicates that the book resource may be improperly structured and worth
redesigning.

**Note:** The word "per" is an exception to this rule, particularly in two
cases. Often "per" is part of a unit (e.g. "miles per hour"), in which case the
preposition must be present to accurately convey the unit. Additionally, "per"
is often appropriate in reporting scenarios (e.g. "nodes per instance" or
"failures per hour").
