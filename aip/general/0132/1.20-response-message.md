### Response message

List methods implement a common response message pattern:

```proto
message ListBooksResponse {
  // The books from the specified publisher.
  repeated Book books = 1;

  // A token, which can be sent as `page_token` to retrieve the next page.
  // If this field is omitted, there are no subsequent pages.
  string next_page_token = 2;
}
```

- The response message **must** include one repeated field corresponding to the
  resources being returned, and **should not** include any other repeated
  fields.
  - The response **should** usually include fully-populated resources unless
    there is a reason to return a partial response (see [AIP-157][]).
- The `next_page_token` field, which supports pagination, **must** be included
  on all list response messages. It **must** be set if there are subsequent
  pages, and **must not** be set if the response represents the final page. For
  more information, see [AIP-158][].
- The message **may** include a `int32 total_size` (or `int64 total_size`)
  field with the number of items in the collection.
  - The value **may** be an estimate (the field **should** clearly document
    this if so).
  - If filtering is used, the `total_size` field **should** reflect the size of
    the collection _after_ the filter is applied.
