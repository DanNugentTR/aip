### Soft-deleted resources

Some APIs need to "[soft delete](/135#soft-delete)" resources, marking them as
deleted or pending deletion (and optionally purging them later).

APIs that do this **should not** include deleted resources by default in list
requests. APIs with soft deletion of a resource **should** include a
`bool show_deleted` field in the list request that, if set, will cause
soft-deleted resources to be included.
