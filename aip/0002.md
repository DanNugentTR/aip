# AIP Numbering

The AIP system provides a mechanism to index and have a single source of truth
for API Improvement Proposals, as well as iterate on them collaboratively and
transparently.

This document describes the AIP numbering system.

## Assigning AIP Numbers

The AIP editors (see [AIP-1](./0001.md)) are responsible for assigning a number
to each AIP when it is accepted as a draft for review. Importantly, _all_ AIPs
have numbers, not just approved ones. The [AIP Index](/) clearly delineates
which AIPs are approved and binding and which are under discussion.

The editors may decide to reserve a specific block of numbers for groups of
AIPs that are related in some way (for example, that are only scoped to a
specific subset of APIs).

Beyond this, AIP numbers are assigned arbitrarily. In general, the editors will
take the next AIP number off of the stack to assign to a draft AIP, but
occasionally may use a special/joke number if useful for mnemonic or other
reasons.

### Multiple organizations

While multiple organizations and companies **may** adopt the AIP system to
describe their guidance, and while that guidance **may** differ from
organization to organization, the AIP numbers are designed to be global. As an
example, [AIP-131](./0131.md) always describes guidelines for single-resource
read methods, regardless of which organization's AIPs is consulted.

### Organization-specific AIPs

If an organization desires an AIP where the _concept_ is unlikely to be
applicable outside of the organization, that organization **should** add a
prefix. This prefix acts as a namespace, with no expectation of synergy in AIP
numbers between namespaces.

For example, if Google chose to write internal AIPs around how to leverage its
internal infrastructure properly, it may prefix these with `GOOG`, resulting in
AIPs of the format: AIP GOOG-1, AIP GOOG-42, etc.

Prefixes **must** be unique within a single fork of the AIP repository, but are
not expected to be globally unique.
